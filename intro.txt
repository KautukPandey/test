Hi, I'm Kautuk Pandey, a passionate and curious Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development and problem-solving. Iâ€™m currently focused on mastering the MERN stack and sharpening my Data Structures and Algorithms skills. I enjoy building real-world projects like DropHope, a donation platform, and experimenting with creative content through YouTube Shorts. Alongside tech, I actively engage in basketball and fitness, believing in a balanced and consistent lifestyle. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful solutions. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer ready for both industry and innovation.
